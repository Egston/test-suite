## DebOps - Test suite

Chugging away at writing Ansible tests.

### What is this repository about?

It is all of the tests written for the [DebOps test runner](https://github.com/debops/test-runner). You can use them as a guide for both writing your own tests and seeing how to use each DebOps role.
