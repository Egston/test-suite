# An example showing how to set a random 20 character password in your role.
mysql_root_password: "{{ lookup('password', secret + '/credentials/' + ansible_fqdn + '/mysql/root/passwordi length=20') }}"
 

# That will create a random 20 character password file in:
# credentials/somehost/mysql/root/password
#
# It is relative to your custom inventory.secret path by default.


# You can even go back later and change the password to something else and
# the next time you run the playbook it will be updated on somehost.
